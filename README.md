- 👋 Hi, I’m Shaheryar Syed
- 👀 I’m interested in building software & hardware related things that contribute to society in a meaningful manner.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various software development languages such as C#, C++, Visual Basic, Java, Python, Javascript (including React and Next.js), HTML and CSS.
- I have built various VPN networks utilizing OpenVPN, IPSec, L2TP, and SquidProxy amongst many others from scratch using multiple Linux distributions (ie. CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu) as well as Windows Server.
- I have also had the pleasure of building fully functioning web servers utilizing Cloudflare through Apache, Nginx, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and PostFix, alongside many other open softwares available on Windows & Linux.
